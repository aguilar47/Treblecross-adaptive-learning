# Treblecross-adaptive-learning

Treblecross is a one-dimensional version of tic-tac-toe on a linear board of n squares with both players
using X; the first player to complete 3 Xâ€™s in a row wins. Note: The X's do not need to be your own.

This implementation of Treblecross uses the Matchbox game-learning method. The goal of this project was to figure out if the player that makes the first move has the advantage or the player that makes the second move, for n number of squares. This was achieved by having the computer play against itself thousands of times. The output of this program is simply the amount of wins that each player had. However, modifications can be made so that a human can play against the computer. The more games that are played the better the computer gets.
